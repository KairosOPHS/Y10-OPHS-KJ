#This is a comment
#Variables VS Constants
#Variables are declared in titlecase 
#CONSTANTS ARE DECLARED IN CAPITALS

#Example of variable

Team1Name = "Kairos FC"
Team2Name = "Man U"

#Variables have a useful name 
#Variables store a value(can change)
#Variables can not start with a number
#e.g. 1TeamName = "Man U"
#This will cause a syntax error 

#Variables can not have a space in the name
#e.g. Team Name = "Man U"
#This will be a syntax error

#This is an example of a CONSTANT
FREETHROW = 1
TWOPOINTER = 2
THREEPOINTER = 3

#The values in a constant do NOT change
